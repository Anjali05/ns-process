# ns-process

Code to accompany the [Namespaces in Go](https://medium.com/@teddyking) series
of articles.

## Usage

Each of the code extracts in the articles reference a git tag, which can be
checked out from this repo. The code is buildable and runnable at each tag, but
note that it will only run successfully on Linux machines.

## Testing

The test suite isn't explicitly mentioned in the articles, but if you'd like to
run the tests you'll need to install [ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)
and [gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega).  Note that some of the tests may
require root privileges.
